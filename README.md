This repository shows the complete process of a client having a problem and providing data and then I provide them with a detialed analytical plan, my preliminary findings, and then my final results as well as a report summarizing all my findings.

### Dictionary
<li>Analytic Plan.Rmd -- Code where I looked at data and familiarized myself with it by looking at data types, histograms, and data summaries. 
<li>Preliminary Results.Rmd -- Code where I created some models and got some inital accuracies.
<li>Final Project.Rmd -- Final code which included the tweaked neural network, and using AUC and ROC curves for accuracy.

### Reports
<li>DSE6211 Analytic-Plan Report.docx -- report of my plan and findings.
<li>DSE6211 Preliminary Results Report.docx -- report of my intial findings and the models used, as well as addressing any feedback my "client" gave me.
<li>DSE6211 Final Report.docx -- Final report which I give my definitive answer as well as tweaking the models to see if I can get a better outcome.
  
### .csv file
<li>project_data.csv -- Dataset which my "client" provided.
